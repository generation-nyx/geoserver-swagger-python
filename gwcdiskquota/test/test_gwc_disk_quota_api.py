    GeoWebCache DiskQuota

    The REST API for Disk Quota management provides a RESTful interface through which clients can configure the disk usage limits and expiration policies for a GeoWebCache instance through simple HTTP calls.  Since disk usage increases geometrically by zoom level, one single seeding task could fill up an entire storage device. Because of this, GeoWebCache employs a disk quota system where one can specify the maximum amount of disk space to use for a particular layer, as well as logic on how to proceed when that quota is reached. There are two different policies for managing the disk quotas - Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Least Recently Used (LRU).  # noqa: E501
