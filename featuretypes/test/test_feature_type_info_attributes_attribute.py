    GeoServer Feature Types

    A feature type is a vector based spatial resource or data set that originates from a data store. In some cases, such as with a shapefile, a feature type has a one-to-one relationship with its data store. In other cases, such as PostGIS, the relationship of feature type to data store is many-to-one, feature types corresponding to a table in the database.  # noqa: E501
